# Nurse-Schedule-GA

Using Genetic Algorithm to solve VRP with Nurses and patients.

## Problem

The problem is to route nurses to patients within time-constraints and capacity constraints.

## Solution

Using Genetic Algorithm.


### Methods

Methods are mostly split into random, greedy or some sort of heuristics based as with clustered methods.

#### Initiation

#### Mutations

 - Random
 - Greedy

#### Crossover

#### Population Management

### Implementation

For extra speedup I have tried to use numpy and numba on most functions. The process could further be diversified and sped up with multiprocessing.

### Sources

Mostly basic ideas, with initial explanation by presentations and guest lectures in class and Optimization.
